# DSPCal 

The **D**ifferential **S**cattering **P**arameters **Cal**culator: A small open-source software tool designed to calculate electron-photon scattering phenomena based on user input parameters. It can handle both single energy-angle pairs and multiple energy-angle ranges. The program provides detailed information such as momentum transfer, Klein-Nishina cross-section, Thomson cross-section, and total Mott differential scattering cross-section (TMMDSC).

To install the code and use on a computer with a Linux operating system you can clone this repository and run the following command on a terminal.

```
python3 dspcal.py
```

To use the program on a computer with a Windows operating system please send an email to `physics.calculation@gmail.com` using your email adress with `.edu` extension. Then, you will get a link to download the `DSPCal.exe` file.
